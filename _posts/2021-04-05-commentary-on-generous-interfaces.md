In comparing Works and Networks interface to the Decade Browser, it is evident that the idea of creating structures within collections is a feat that can’t be accomplished by an interface like the Decade Browser. For the interface to work to its best ability, it has to have a target goal, and it can miss out on other opportunities to enhance browsing at the same time. This is why I found it interesting that the Australian Prints and Printmaking Collection had three separate interfaces created. My first thought was why couldn’t these different aspects of the collection be connected together? What are kinds of connections are we missing out on because they are separated? I think one of the best pros of generous interfaces is the ability to directly make comparisons between works. A lot of my own personal experiences in searching for new suggestions have come up with little to show. Often searching for resources in art history or contemporary art only really give results if you have the right words or phrases so search, and from there the suggested options are a jumping off point.

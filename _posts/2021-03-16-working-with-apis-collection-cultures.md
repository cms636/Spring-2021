title: 'Working with APIs: Collection cultures'
author: Justin Blinder
---
I was curious about the number of works in the Harvard collection for each culture (accessed from the api). Since there were a lot of cultures (250+ ?), I opted for a heatmap representation instead of charts/ graphs. I also wanted to create a collage of all of the images for each culture sorted by color, however this would have taken 2000k+ api calls per P5.js page visit. Wanting to be a good nieghbor, I just grabbed the images for cultures that had 10 or less works in the collection and grouped them by dominant color.

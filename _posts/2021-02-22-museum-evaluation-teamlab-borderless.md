I looked at the [website](https://borderless.teamlab.art/) for teamLab Borderless, an immersive digital art museum in Tokyo that seeks to break down boundaries between art and technology, and between entities of the world altogether. Immediately upon accessing the website, the viewer is greeted by a series of video clips of the immersive rooms, which take up nearly the entire screen. The video clips pan around the rooms, recreating the experience of actually being in the immersive rooms and exploring the surroundings with your gaze. Through sprawling digital projections, the rooms don’t feel like carefully curated enclosures but rather an infinite landscape, or as teamLab’s website calls it — a “borderless world.” The website clearly communicates teamLab’s futuristic take on the museum, one that I’d absolutely love to visit if I get the chance to. 

There’s an interactive app for learning more about the exhibitions/immersive experience as you go through the, but the website does not contain any resources beyond what’s needed for an actual visit. 

Gaining entrance to the museum isn’t very accessible, as tickets must be purchased ahead of time online and not locally at the physical museum. This is probably because having too many people takes away from the immersive experience. Although Japan is faring much better with the pandemic (and allowing museums to be open), entrance has been further limited by covid precautions. This museum isn’t doing much community outreach/engagement outside the museum, but does facilitate interesting community building goals from within. For example, a cafe combines tea drinking with interactive digital art projections to educate the public about traditional Japanese tea culture through a futuristic lens (while making some money to fund the museum). Each artwork flows into other pieces rather than existing as individual entities, and the museum hopes that the museumgoers see themselves as parts of an intermingled system just like the artwork. A “Future Park” exhibit strives to foster “collaborative creativity” between museumgoers, communicating their idea that the future of education should focus on teaching people how to share creativity and simultaneously having people form connections through this idea.

title: 'Curatorial A(i)gents: Surprise Machines'

I explored the Surprise Machines. It is inspired by Turing’s experiment of “imitation game” and the question of whether machines are capable of surprising humans. The “black box” algorithms render uncontrollable behaviors once set in motion, and it collects the entire collection of Harvard Art Museum. Watching the AI collecting artworks is a very soothing experience. Harvard Art museum has a huge amount of collections and 99% of them are not accessible. This connects to our group project of artworks that are “lost” in the museum. Because we are still focusing on the artworks that are on view, it is a bit hard to imagine the immensity of not on viewed objects. I think this idea of surprise or randomness allows people to observe and explore the way they never could before.

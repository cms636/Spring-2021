This reading reminded me a lot of Museums in Motion. Both of them present the current trend of museums or other institutions turning to more participatory models as a return to their original form rather than something entirely new. The timeline differs a lot between these two readings with Museums in Motion viewing this as a several thousand year cycle and Museum Making viewing it as only a several hundred year cycle. However I think both interpretations are accurate due to the different ways they choose to frame the change. I also thought the connection made to the hacker ethic was really interesting. I read Steven Levyâ€™s Hackers last year and was surprised by how little I had known about the origins of hacker and maker culture and how significant those origins were.

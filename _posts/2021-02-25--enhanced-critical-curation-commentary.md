In the short piece "Enhanced Critical Curation", there is a suggested dichotomy of collection-building and curating. Where collection-building seems to be the process of archiving and accumulating, a special importance is given to the craft of curating by scholars carefully drawing out a narrative from the noise. When early data was scarce, manual copying (bringing to mind enlighted manuscripts made in monastaries) were understood to be conservation. Now, a mere duplicate made easier with computing tools. On the other hand, I think what has survived from the past is a form of curation itself. When investigating archival silences, it's hard to ignore that someone with views decided that a certain piece was worth collecting not indiscriminantly. 

The piece closes on commentary about the "enormous backlog" of information now available. According to the 7th edition report of Data Never Sleeps, "2.5 quintillion bytes (2.5 e+9 GB) of the data is created every day, and this number is in increasing order. Interestingly, it is said that over 90% of these data are collected within just the past 5 years." Now that there is the technology to discriminate less on what can be collected with less restraint of physical media. You could fill up a terrabyte hard drive with the contents of a small library. Copies and redundancies are to be expected. And so the role of the curator is even more important in this sea of information.

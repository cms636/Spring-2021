The Lascaux IV was designed with a remarkable dedication to authenticity. Even though Lascaux IV was created specifically to be more accessible than its predecessors, no change was to the presentation or physical structure of the cave without careful deliberation of the trade off being made. Two examples of this really stood out to me. The slope of the cave was granted special permission to be steeper than would normally be legal in order to preserve the angle at which the artwork would be seen. It was also decided to have almost no physical labels or descriptions anywhere in the facsimile. I think this challenge, and the way the designer approached it, is fascinating.

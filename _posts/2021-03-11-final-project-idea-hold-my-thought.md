**update**

After hearing other people's thoughts, I realized that if I continue moving forward with this project, I would have to add some sense of purpose. For example, someone suggested making the whole experience more game like and to make the outer walls transparent so that the public would be able to see what is happening from the outside. I was also looking at other people's project ideas and realized that Sarah and I were intending to use museums' spaces to create our own experience. I think that there is room for improvement here since what I would ideally want to create is something that is integrated in the museum, that is part of the museum, not that it merely uses the museum as a location.


--------------------

Working Title: Hold My Thought

The museum experience is often regarded as something personal but this doesnâ€™t have to be the only way. I think that museums would benefit a lot from encouraging members of the public to interact with each other and in that way create a more united community. In addition, discussing the presented information with others also helps visitors to retain it in their minds. My audience would be visitors of all ages who would like to experience a connection with someone else. Who would like to try something different and share their thoughts with another person. The intended museum collaborator would be any museum that is open to the idea of getting their public more involved with the exhibits through mutual communication. The Boston MFA or the MIT science museum  could be interesting options to explore. 

My project idea would be to build two small rooms adjacent to each other inside a space of the museum. They would have an entrance on opposite sides and a chair in the middle facing the other room. There will be a projector displaying some of the items of the museum on the walls of each of the rooms. A question will then appear on the wall dividing the two rooms but only for one room. The person will be asked to read it outloud and, through a microphone, the person in the other room will hear it and answer it. Then this person will be the one asking a question. Questions will be about items in the museum, or items that are being projected on the walls. Their interpretations, if they like them or not, etc. But other questions will be more about the person, such as what makes you happy? Why did you come to the museum today? etc. I think that mixing the questions will not only create a bond between the people but also a bond between these people and the museum.

Skills needed for this project: Video editing skills for the projection in the room. Some coding skills perhaps to write a program that will output these questions.

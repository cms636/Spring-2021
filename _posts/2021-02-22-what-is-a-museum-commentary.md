The evolution of museums presented in _Museums in Motion_ wasn’t what I expected. While I was aware of the early Greek and Roman institutions referred to here as “prototype museums,” I hadn’t previously thought of them as being direct ancestors to modern museums. This lineage is used to suggest the idea that the current trend of museums becoming more accessible and interactive is actually a return to their original purpose. Before this reading, I would have put the origins of museums in the Middle Ages with the purpose of collecting objects and educating a small elite. Under that model, I viewed the current, shifting idea of museums as a departure from their original role; albeit a welcome one.

Another small point that really stood out to me was the description of the origins of admissions fees for museums. I grew up in the Washington, DC area and as a result, my early ideas of museums were heavily shaped by the Smithsonian Institution. The Smithsonian museums have a staggering number of exhibits and artifacts from a number of different fields and are all available to the public free of charge. I’m sympathetic to the fact that the staff of many museums that charge an admission fee would probably rather offer free admission if it were financially viable. But, I still have always had a slight bias against paid admission museums. It was interesting to learn that the first museums to charge admissions fees were formerly closed museums that were now opening to the public for the first time rather than new institutions which opened with that as their initial business model.

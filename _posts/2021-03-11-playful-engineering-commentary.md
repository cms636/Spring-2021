The Artbot project was an interesting read on creating ways for users to find cultural objects, exhibitions, and events. I liked the way that the app maintained two methods of providing information, with an algorithmically gathered selection and a serendipitously generated selection. Whenever I see an external application like this, it makes me wonder if there are issues with implementation and actually getting people to use it. On the converse side, I also wonder if applications like Artbot now exist in major platforms such as Google but are drowned out by the company’s plethora of extensions and resources. I wonder if there’s ever a good place to be when it comes to having people utilize your work — publicize it as its own thing through various platforms? Attach it to a more known platform (such as affiliating it with the MFA or some other major museum)? Thinking about reaching audiences makes me wonder if there is ever a ‘right way’ to approach publicizing and deploying resources, or if to some extent it is just up to the people themselves and how they interact with it over time.

For many people, it is so easy to store something digital (as opposed to something physical) that the so many more content creators thrive. On YouTube, anyone can be a filmmaker. On WordPress, anyone can be a writer. And they will have an audience. We aren’t limited to the select number of artists who find their way into famous museums, theaters, libraries. Anyone with an internet connection can access these artists anywhere. Of course, there are costs to storing this much content. Energy is powering and cooling servers that store these data. When we store this much content, the treasures can get lost. How do we continue to curate when the storage space is seemingly endless?

A slight tangent from the humanities, but still somewhat relevant to the general topic: Slack got its name from “Searchable Log of All Conversation and Knowledge.” My thoughts: while Slack may have all digital conversation data (if a group uses only Slack for communication), it certainly doesn’t have “all knowledge” because people don’t to write down everything they know and send it to others in a message. Even on the communication side, Slack can’t catalog all the face-to-face or zoom-to-zoom conversations that happen.

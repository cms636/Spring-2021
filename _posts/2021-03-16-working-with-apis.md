I think it took me a bit to understand what was going on so I just played around the code of the second example. I added an ellipse everytime the mouse hovers over the timeline kind of like a reminder of where the user has already looked. I wouldn't say this is particularly helpful but I think it's fun to watch all the shapes overlap as you go through each event.

I never actually gave much thought to how museums, libraries or galleries brought information to users through their websites. I honestly thought that just using keywords to match what the user wanted to what was available was a pretty good option but after reading only the first paragraph of this article, I realize how wrong I was. In addition, I also never considered that there are indeed a large group of people who visit these websites without a specific goal. They just want to stumble upon something they like. 

I was recently introduced to this website: [https://feralatlas.supdigital.org/](https://feralatlas.supdigital.org/) . It is a bit hard to navigate but I think that is the beauty of it. You are immersed in a big sea of information and the user is actually not sure of what they will encounter. 

I think it is hard to just escape from the typical search box. Humans do not really like change and a negative thing that could come with changing the interphase website used to deliver information is to lose some old visitors. But overall I honestly think that this is a change that museums and libraries need to make. Maybe it is not the same solution for every website. Maybe the changes in search will depend on what the museum or gallery has to offer. But I do indeed see the need of making this process more natural and intuitive for the user.

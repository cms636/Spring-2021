I created a really long layout with the idea that it could be folded into a small pamphlet. I have a basic theme that I've expressed but I thought I would just clarify that my whole theme was choosing obscure or interesting items that my friends and I have collected while living on the same floor for the past semester. Two of them ended up going home for this semester so my room is shoved full of random things they couldn't store. ![]({{site.baseurl}}/)![oddities of the caz penthouse.png]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/oddities of the caz penthouse.png)

I included an image here but it might be easier to zoom into through this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1meZSqXje_No_h-Nay92xeiJr6DiYuPKU/view?usp=sharing).

[Provoke](http://soundboxproject.com/) is a collection of projects which use sound in pushing the boundaries of scholarly presentation. In addition to the sonic documentation of their research areas, the authors of these projects also —as the name "Provoke" suggests—challenge existing modes of research and presentation, uniting the forwarding-thinking agendas of the digital humanities and of sound studies. Read more about the collection at [soundboxproject.com/about.html](http://soundboxproject.com/about.html).

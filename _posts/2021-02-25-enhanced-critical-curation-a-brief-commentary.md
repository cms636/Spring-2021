The reading “Enhanced Critical Curation” posed the importance of curation in a digital environment. Where traditionally scholars would have to sift through a literary database or search through a research library, in the modern age Google Books can provide all of that and more. The issue of knowledge before was that there was not enough available to a person at a time: in a way, it was like someone searching for food and immediately gobbling up the morsels they could find. Now, there’s too much food to eat and the question lies not about getting the food itself but picking the right food to eat. The thought of ‘picking’ makes me wonder if you can ever avoid curation in the digital collections we have today. I would argue that it’s not possible — when there is a surplus of knowledge, no matter what methodology is used to slim those sources down, the act of curation is still taking place.

Lauren Styx’s article on the implementation of AI in museums writes about the use of artificial intelligence for the museum-goer and for the internal use of museums. Reading about the various examples, I feel that artificial intelligence is more useful for the behind-the-scenes types of applications more than the visitor experience. Styx writes that AI is already being used in administrative applications, such as to optimize ticket availability based on the amount of advanced ticket holders that don’t show up. In the meanwhile, there are less widespread applications of AI in the user experience. I wonder if this is due to the lack of exploration being put into AI in the museum experience or if it’s related to the properties of museums themselves. AI is used for a tailored experience in digital applications such as streaming services and shopping sites, but the museum itself still exists in a physical space. To try to digitalize the space can take away from the experience by altering the environment. I also wonder how helpful the AI bots are mentioned in the article — I remember speaking with Pepper when I visited the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington DC, but I can’t remember if I actually asked the robot questions about art or if I was more interested in interacting with it as something that used AI. I feel like it would just take a lot of testing and surveys to get an implementation of AI in a museum that would enrich user experience, mostly because it’s hard to gauge how the tool actually impacts visitors. It could be seeing a lot of use for the novelty of the item, but that doesn’t indicate visitors are using the tool to engage more or learn more about museum objects.

Mitchell Whitelaw argues that for digital collections, queries by themselves are insufficient because it requires the user to already know what they are searching for, preventing the organic, less structured browsing that happens organically in a physical museum. Several “generous interfaces” that encourage user exploration of the collection have attempted to address this issue. 

I think overall, these interfaces all succeed in giving the viewer a broad overview of the collection and encourage deeper exploration at least to some extent. One of the limitations to these interfaces that Whitelaw has brought up is that many of these overviews are highly constructed themselves, which biases which pieces in the collection get viewed more and consequently pushes other pieces into relative obscurity. For example, Manly Images chooses a preview image as the ‘face’ of each cluster. (Through the lens of the “Lost Art” project group, the curators become the only ones at fault here for the ‘lost’, less visited pieces.) A potential solution to the specific case of Manly Images would be to rotate the pieces that get featured. Google queries are not deterministic, so I think a similar concept can be applied to these overview interfaces. Perhaps the ‘face’ of each cluster can be a relatively obscure piece, and it gets rotated out once that piece no longer becomes obscure.

This short piece contains some interesting thoughts on collection-building and curation, and comments on the extent in which digital curation has had an impact on it. I find it quite striking the fact that in a way technology has not exactly facilitated the curation and conservation process but instead it might have actually made it more complicated. It used to be that manual copy was a form of conservation. It took time, effort, and a lot of skill. Nowadays, it could not be easier to copy something in the digital world. This could be potentially regarded as a positive aspect but I believe that, in a way, this ease to copy, save, manipulate and share digital archives has damaged the ancient art of collection-building and curation. A backlog of multimedia document collections is mentioned towards the end of this short piece. There is an information overload because the practice of critical curation becomes increasingly more difficult as technology continues developing and granting people access to more information and resources.

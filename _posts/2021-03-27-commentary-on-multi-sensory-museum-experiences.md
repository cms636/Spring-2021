This reading brought up a couple concepts that were already mentioned before. Generally, the sense of sight is what continues to be essential to visitor experiences, and the white washed visuals of galleries and exhibitions seem to be off putting. Most technologically integrated ideas have still failed to provide users with a satistfying reply. The ASK Brooklyn Museum app sounds interesting, but how does it tackle the obstacle of a only a small percentage of users wanting to download the app? Is this app just a stand in for a docent? Is it trying to replicated a genuinely human interaction? I question is how the idea of having two way flows of information can be better incorporated to new ideas of multi-sensory interactions. Hands on environments and relatable narratives are all valid attempts at enhancing the experience, but should visitors have more of an impact on what is exhibited and curated as a whole?

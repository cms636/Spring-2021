I like Styx’s comparison of very outward and visible applications of AI like Berenson the robotic art critic and Pepper, a helpful resource for viewers with questions, in comparison to more discreet uses of AI such as websites and chat boxes. Additionally, the examples like Recognition and the Google Arts and Culture Art Selfie show ways in which we can use AI to integrate present day happenings of other people, or us, and connect ourselves in artwork in a streamlined way. Styx also brings up a point that I’ve never really had to think about, how money can be saved as a result of operational data to effectively manage resources. I think that there are many ways that museums benefit from AI. I do question what kinds of ethical questions the use of AI raises, as commented on by Chris Michaels, and the kinds of biases it may instill or continue to perpetuate?

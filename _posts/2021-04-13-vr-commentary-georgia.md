I read about Apple’s AR art walks through Central Park and Jeff Koons’ VR _Phryne_. Both have a physical component that draws a viewer into the AR/VR experience. Apple Stores offering this art walk all showcase a piece by one of the artists. Jeff Koons VR ballerina is inspired by his inflated _Seated Ballerina_. 

We’ve heard from Tamiko Thiel that getting museum visitors to download an app is one of the hardest parts about working with AR or VR. Having a physical introduction to what could be is an interesting way to show this possibility. In terms of showing ARticulate in a physical way, I can imagine a single piece of art that has projections of visitors’ annotations. A tablet to the side could cycle through the text comments that visitors left. This piece would only need to be on one piece at the front of the museum, and instructions for how to download and use ARticulate would accompany it.

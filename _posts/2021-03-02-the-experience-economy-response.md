The Experience Economy proposes the idea that in order to be engaging, an experience should “alter a guest’s sense of reality.” When I think of an immersive experience where a guest is transported to a completely new world, I think of teamLab’s sprawling digital art environments and virtual reality. I agree that immersion/altering reality makes for an engaging learning environment, especially if you can get students to “walk a mile in someone else’s shoes” when learning about social sciences. But many/most museums, classrooms, or educational spaces don’t have the resources to physically change people’s realities in the same way that teamLab does so. In that case, I feel like more weight is put on how the information can be presented such that key takeaways are memorable for students. The Experience Economy seems to focus on entertainment driven experiences such as live performance, restaurants, etc, but can these same principles be applied to experiences that aren’t as traditionally entertaining, like teaching algebra?

AI, as mentioned in the article, is both risk and opportunity. AI has or will have the ability to assist people in many different ways. I think the presence of AI in museum may face similar questions like how to make the incorporation of AI feel not intrusive to the museum experience. Personally I may feel hesitated to interact with near-human robots like Berenson, but the analytics tools like websites and chatbots seem to me more preferable approaches. It would be interesting to see how AI boosts the museum experience instead of taking over the experience. I agree that the major applications of AI will come under the hood of museum operations. Especially with the immensity of museum collections that came online, AI can help to provide optimal management of these collections. Currently, museums are hoping to learn more about their visitors, what they are interested in and what their behaviors reflect. AI could be helpful in terms of gathering and analyzing data collected from visitors, which can further help museums to learn about their audiences.

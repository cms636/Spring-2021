I created a collection called "Memory Leaks". It's a series of objects containing currpted data that now serve as momentos of past experiences.

I made a poster with the images and desciptions and also created a [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1GzxqTWQvSCrqg7neiYQE4Y4ZUicUfE527hKBLxA-dFQ/edit?usp=sharing).

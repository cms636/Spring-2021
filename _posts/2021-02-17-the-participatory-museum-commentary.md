I think the participatory model Simone proposes enriches our analysis and understanding of cultural artifacts, as these objects are being explored through unforeseen and diverse lenses (e.g. race, gender). Her call to transform museums into "audience-centered" community centers in which "visitors can create, share, and connect with each other around content" ensures these institutions are actually in conversation with their surrounding environment and create reciprocity. I think this is a crucial step towards more inclusive and equitable museums, and opens up new possibilities for the kinds of archives that they collect, curate, and exhibit.

Her proposals made me consider the immense responsibility (and control) museums have in curating the dominant narrative of history, and what artifacts deserve recognition. Marxist theorist Antonio Gramsci highlighted this in what he coined "cultural hegemony", in which the ruling class maintains dominance by controlling culture and belief rather than overt forms of power. Museums, then, maintain immense political power in how they present history and who is included and excluded. 

Simone's ideas of participatory cultural institutions don't involve dismantling or reconfiguring museums, but rather helping to distribute power among the community. I agree that this transformation from didactic to dialogic spaces allows for community perspectives to be included in archives and curatiorial practice instead of solely institution leaders. However, I’m curious if this is enough for certain communities who experience some/ all of the five forms of dissatisfaction she outlines, especially those who express: “The authoritative voice of the institution doesn’t include my view or give me context for understanding what’s presented”. Are there existing/ new models of museums that are community-built from the ground up and democratically run? Is it possible for a museum to be completely devoid of an “authoritative voice”?

[Architecture comes alive](https://nextpittsburgh.com/latest-news/architecture-comes-alive-through-carnegie-museum-of-arts-new-plaster-recast-augmented-reality-app/) through Carnegie Museum of Art’s new Plaster ReCast augmented reality app.
[Plaster ReCast](https://vimeo.com/246512401), a new augmented reality app, created by CMU’s Entertainment Technology Center under the supervision of Bard and fellow architecture professor Dr. Francesca Torello, is designed to help visitors better engage with the CMOA’s plaster cast collection. The app allows guests to explore the Hall while learning about several select pieces. Three interaction modes allow you to more closely investigate 3D scans of the casts, pull up detailed models of the building to which it once belonged, and read about a cast’s history, complete with scans of old documents and images.

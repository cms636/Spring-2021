I thought “Enhanced Critical Curation” helped highlight how curatorial methodologies have evolved to confront the massive collections of artifacts and data accumulating in the "post-print" era. The description of catalogs as "an art of memory that is also an art of data compression and of performance" made me think about the contemporary challenges within critical curation to form effective narratives from unwieldy collections of data. It seems that critical curation involves straddling the line between reductively and nuance, trying to craft a bifocal representation that retains important context. The reading also made me curious about contemporary approaches to curating massive, non-textual archives (e.g. images, audio). How does one attempt to organize and make meaning from massive collections of media that are difficult to search semantically? When exploring theses archives, what does qualitative analysis look like at scale?

One thing that I’ve been wondering about museums is what should be the optimal distance between museum and myself, or the public in general. When I went to museums like MFA and MoMA and looked at those artworks, I felt heavy as if the exhibits exerted a repulsive force on me, especially those that are hard to understand upon first glance. Alexander talks about how museums evolved from private collections to public museums that we have today. Museums in the past were very exclusive to the ones with power, money, leisure, or knowledge, both on individual and national level. The access to museums seemed to indicate divisions of social hierarchy, which explains the chaotic situation when museums first became public. The collectors and visitors, both with very different expectations, were all disappointed with each other. I feel that this sense of disappointment changed and evolved and still left a sense of misfit today, which is usually expressed partly as the incomprehensibility and elitism of museums. 

Also, it is interesting to think about the perspective and standpoint of a museum. I totally agree that museums, as inventions of men, are naturally biased even though they seem to or try to be unbiased. I really like what Michael Ames said, that “museums are implicitly compared with and subordinnated to contemporary established values and social reality”. Museums are not only collections of the past, but they are immersed in various social contexts. Probably one of the reasons that visitors feel alienated when they are inside museums is that there’s not enough context given. People lost themselves in time and space, but I don’t think this is a bad thing. On the contrary, this is part of the unique nature of museums that makes them more than just collections.

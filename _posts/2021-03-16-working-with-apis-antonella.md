title: Working with APIs -Antonella
author: Antonella Masini

I am completely new to working with APIs so it took me a while to understand it. In the end, I created this histogram of the frist 8 cultures that when you click on it the bars change of color and display the object count. However, for some reason it sometimes crashes and so you need to refresh the page some times for it to work. I am still trying to figure out why this happens.

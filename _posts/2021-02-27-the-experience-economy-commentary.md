It seems to me that the experiences companies are trying to sell are both universal and individual. They design an experience that appeals to all audiences in a different way. It allows the audiences to enter another reality by manipulating their sensory perceptions. This is probably one of the reasons why, under the covid situation, a lot of museums made virtual tours that attempted to make audiences feel more engaged, to mimic an actual museum experience. I feel that among time, space, and matter, space is the most important factor because, for example, physically stepping into a museum and perceiving the dimensions and arrangement of artworks are simply enough for the audience to feel that they’ve entered another world. 

I visited two online artist book fairs during the pandemic. Even though this allowed me to “go to” fairs in Tokyo and New York City, which I might not be able to participate in if they were not online, they still feel very distanced to me. I would still prefer to go to a book fair in person so I can go to different tables, turn the pages of books, and have conversations with my friends and artists. Although both online and in-person modes are very self-directed, the level of engagement is still different. Even though memorable experiences are created by engagin audiences in a personal way, the presence of others seems to enhance experience on an individual level. A collective dream is much more real than an individual one, but here we are trapped in our own spaces and try to connect with each other by putting our heads together in adjoining rectangles.

I struggled a lot with the exercise and working with the data coming in. I haven't used javascript before so it was difficult to process the data and also display it on the canvas. In the end I created a list of mediums that have more than 300 instances in the collection. The way I kept track of the frequency and name of the medium were separated in a way that I couldn't order them, and I had a hard time working with the data when they were together. In the end I kept them separate, so the list isn't ordered.

Even though we are talking about how to incorporate technology in museums, sometimes technological devices at the museum don’t feel very comfortable to use, or not a lot of people choose to interact with art using the devices. To the users, even groups that rely more heavily on technology, devices can be intrusive to the museum experience sometimes. Desi Gonzalez mentioned the importance of providing a self-directed and social experience. The visually impaired visitors, just like other visitors, would like to participate the way they like instead of being led the entire time. Adding to the fact that they usually go to the museum with companions, technology can be a very helpful tool, but seems to be better for the devices to be available when needed. This also makes me think about the presence of technology in museums. Even for more tech-dependent visitors, they hope to have “things that [they] can do with one hand”. In other words, visitors don’t want the thought of “I’m using technology” to stand out during the experience because inconvenience caused by technology is disruptive of the experience as a whole. I feel that this is something important to keep in mind when designing technology directing toward museum experience.

I found Ímesh (To Walk): The “App”Lication Of Indigenous Art And Landscapes At Simon Fraser University very interesting because of the way it was targeted at non-indigenous people while still being functional and meaningful for indigenous people as well. The idea of reclaiming languages, histories, and knowledge through the lens of a university that was not responsive to an art tour in the first place made me question how effective a mobile app could really be. 

I am intrigued by the way they have made an experience that is so fitting towards the situation users walk into, and also the different types of information they are confronted with. I think the idea of having quotes and video clips form artists alongside guiding users to each location can provide a much deeper backstory to the land they currently inhabit. Especially when prompted with how indigenous works often lack description and recognition of past histories, I question where the boundary between artwork and cultural knowledge lies. I also wonder about if decolonization has to occur, on two different levels, physical and historical. If FSU is able to decolonize the western names of their artwork and consider past cultural traditions and techniques, while still being on stolen land, is disrupting the settler mindset every once in a while, enough?

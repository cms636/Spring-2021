Coffee talks a lot about the different uses of museums, and elaborates on different ways in which museum study has relied on stereotypes and culture types. When mentioning the various museums are perceived by users, he mentioned that those who rarely or never visited museums mentioned Indians and Indian History. Though this wasn’t really the focus of the article at all, I just found it interesting in the context of multicultural inclusion. Particularly because of the controversy over museum ownership of Native American items. In comparison with what other people mentioned like ancient artifacts and skeletons, this simply example shows us how museums alter our perceptions of the present, easily erasing and historizing communities that are still alive. 

I also find it interesting that during times of domestic struggle rich white men turned to the arts to “inject hope, purpose, and beauty into a troubled society.” Which is an interesting take coming from some of the most financially free and independent men. Using art to heal “troubled society” is like using paintings as band aids for racism and civil unrest. I think recognizing the roots of America’s expansion and growth within art museums is key to understanding the appeal people felt with “National Culture.” The example of Slavery attracting a larger audience than Alexander Hamilton: The Man Who Made Modern America say a lot about how visitors view museums as spaces that may or may not align with their values. 

Coffee concludes and I think these sentences capture his end thoughts very well “Museums are not socio-cultural isolates, they are important actors within the cultural matrices described throughout this discussion.” Considerations of what is leisure time, how museums construct hierarchies, and ways in which they need to deepen their connections with the communities they serve are all very relevant, given that this was written in 2008. I feel like these arguments are still very valid but ultimately there is still a lot of changes to make. Last year the MFA had an exhibit called Ancient Nubia Now that had gave free admission tickets for students to return with their families. They also worked with many members of the community for interviews and insight. I think these are all great changes in the right direction but there is always more to be done.

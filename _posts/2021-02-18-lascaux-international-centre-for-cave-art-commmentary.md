While reading the article I was really struck by Snøhetta's visitor-centric design process that focused on contemplative continuity. Almost every design decision they made both created an authentic experience and also solved problems— innability to hear guides, being rushed through, not being close enough to the art— that occur when touring the original cave. I thought the use of light-based projections directly onto the cave facsimiles was brilliant. It didn't interfere with/ interrupt the experience and directly added a time-based component/ context to the art. For me, this careful dedication to visitor contemplation was also highlighted by their simple (yet effective) decision to only allow "digital visitor companion" devices to operate in specific locations in order to prevent the technology from interrupting or co-opting the experience.

title: 'Curatorial A(i)gents: This Recommendation System is Broken'
author: Trevor Morrisey

I read about This Recommendation System is Broken but I was unclear on where the use of AI came in and overall found it underwhelming. While the Lost Art project performs data collection to determine which works are receiving less attention than others, this project seems to just use a binary divide between works that are publicly displayed and works that are not. Then, works from the “not publicly displayed” collection are shown one at a time at random. This didn’t feel like a meaningful or useful way to explore the works and also doesn’t give any context to why the chosen works aren’t being displayed.

I chose to review A Flitting Atlas of the Human Gaze just because I found it very fun to play around with. It looks at the gazes within the Harvard Art Museum collection, and as you move your curser (would be an input device in person), it shows all of the works in which a person’s gaze is at that very point. This project reminded me of a research project in art history that I did where I analyzed Edouard Manet’s Le Déjeuner sur l'herbe and the woman’s direct eye contact towards the viewer was such an important part of the painting. The projection map also allows you to see which focal points have the most pieces of art, showing a large or small concentration based on the size of the projected circle. I personally really like this project because it allows you to quickly get a glance of a lot of different artworks, all through a really interesting lens of being looked at by the art. I wonder about what the experience would be like in person, it seems like the scale of the experience would be much larger. It would also be fun to try out this project, then go through the collections and make connections between what was seen before.

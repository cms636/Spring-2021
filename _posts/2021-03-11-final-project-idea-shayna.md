## SnapBlock

- A description of the issue/problem that you are trying to address;

I envision this project extending the museum experience outside the physical museum walls. Given the state of the pandemic, where indoor spaces have occupancy limits and should be avoided generally, it would be beneficial to do outreach to experience museums and other cultural institutions at home, on your own equipment. Much like Tamiko Thiel and her associate's approach to guerilla AR art such as at the "invasion" of the Met, I could see extending AR filters as an intentional part of a museum. 

I propose creating Snapchat Lenses (live 3D image filters) with relevant experiences for different places of museum significance in the MIT area. It could indicate spots for best viewing, and have a "map" of codes to activate each lens at the right spot, elevating a walking tour to an experience. Much like how audio tours hope to enhance a museum visit, I think this experience can use the museum curation to enhance a visit just outside the museum. 

In particular, I'm interested in creating an interactive demo overlaying AR representations of the Minecraft-ified buildings on campus, with a small "coloring" palette as a test.

- The envisioned audience for your project;

Museum visitors of all ages that can use a smartphone would be able to use this program, and it's likely to would capture a wide range of ages and interests.

- Potential museum collaborators (currently MFA; Harvard Art Museums, MIT-Museum, Getty, and
others are possible as well);

The MIT Museum is an obvious collaborator due to the central location in the MIT area and its relation to historical sites and places of technological significance just a stone's throw away.

- The technological approach (if part of the project)

A Augmented Reality experience built as a Snapchat Lens. The software LensStudio is well supported, and Snapchat being a common enough messaging app, would be able to get this project in the hands of more people.

- Skill sets needed for your project.

Some level of 3D design and familiarity with scripting would be needed for the project.

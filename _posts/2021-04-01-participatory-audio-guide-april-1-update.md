Based on the feedback it seems like our best plan of action would be to use the museum visitors phone as the recording device. We can design an interface that generates prompts based on location or artwork viewed. Playing with outdoor artworks also opens a lot of opportunities and helps tackle the issue of having to have a separate recording room. For technology we are still looking into Roundware but it seems like it fits a lot of our needs. One potential challenge with Roundware is that it seems to be used to make continuous soundscapes rather than discrete recordings that can be listened to. We will have to spend some more time experimenting with Roundware to make sure that it allows for enough distinct comments on a piece. Yellow Arrow also brings up another aspect of the recording experience which is time. We are still thinking about if the user should have access to record notes before or after visiting. 

Meeting with museums that have more outdoor based artwork would be really helpful. The idea of perspective in viewing one piece is something we talked about as a team. Specifically with larger artwork we thought of how a viewer could hear different voice recordings based on where the person recording it was standing. As there was an art installation in Cambridge with a similar concept using Roundware a few years ago, we would want to make sure that our project is distinct from this in some way. 

As for some clarifications on our problem statement, our goal focuses on not changing the art itself, but instead shifting the context it is viewed in through the comments of others. We hope to make the experience of engaging with the art more dynamic by allowing the visitor to hear from different voices and understand the artwork from different perspectives every time they return to the museum.

_Surprise Machines_ uses an algorithm to download and display images of the Harvard Art Museum’s collection in real time. The goal is to surprise visitors at the immensity of the pollution. In 5 minutes, only 5% of the images have been downloaded. I was certainly impressed at the scale of the collection and the effort the machine took to display the images. I’m not sure I would say I’m surprised (which was the intended reaction). Perhaps we have been talking about this very subject too much for me to be surprised. I’m sure plenty of visitors who aren’t aware of the stored collections would be surprised though! They might even feel like they are missing an essential part of the museum by not being able to access all of these works. I recommend the Lost Art team take a look at this project if they haven’t already.

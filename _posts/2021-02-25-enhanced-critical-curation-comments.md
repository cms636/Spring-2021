This reading reminds me of a situation I hear about a lot in software development where the workflow for analytics is often to collect as much data as possible first and then decide what to do with it later (if at all). For now, collecting and storing digital data is easy and fairly autonomous for museums. But, if the current trend continues, this collection of useless information may begin to take up more and more resources. It could then get to the point where it starts to impede museums efforts to work with useful data.

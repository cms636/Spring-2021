Georgia came to MIT as an undergrad in 2011, and she hasn’t been able to leave since! She is currently a PhD student in the Global Engineering and Research Lab where she designs low-cost solar-powered irrigation systems for smallholder farmers in Sub-Saharan Africa. She has a passion for hands-on education, and she is a staff member for 2.009: Product Engineering Processes and 2.00b: Toy Product Design.

When she is not in the lab, she might be swimming, skiing, traveling, doing ceramics, or sewing plushie toys. She has a dream of one day writing a children’s book.

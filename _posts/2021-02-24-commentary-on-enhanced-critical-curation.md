"Enhanced Critical Curation" made me think of museum collections as compartmentalized groups, all stuffed with tons to tell a story. Seeing how Google Books has scanned "over 500 times the entire corpus of knowledge seemingly available in the ancient world" but also acknowledging the ways our memories are incapable of ever comprehending that much material makes curating and paring down what information is worth looking at essential to choosing what is worth spending time on. Expanding our scope has really taken on the viewpoint that curation exists in all senses of organization and creating a cultural record, that extends way beyond just artifacts and historical knowledge. In a way I wonder where the concept of curation really ends. How do we quantify what is impactful to the record of humankind? And finally, how it can be used for harm? If our biases are evident and affect the ways items are curated, would that collection act as that the most accurate depiction of humankind in that time period?

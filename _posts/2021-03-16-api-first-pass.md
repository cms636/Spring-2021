I haven't worked in javascript before, and I have very little experience with OOP, so I spent a while getting used to the syntax. So far, I've made a [histogram](https://editor.p5js.org/gdvdz/full/lGmmpe9Eb) of the first 100 cultures that was suggested as a first example.

I'll keep working to get something a bit more interesting, and I'll update this post when I do!

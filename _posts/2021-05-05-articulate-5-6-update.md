## Research

On Tuesday, our team had a call with Kristen Valenti, who manages visitor experience evaluation within interpretation at the MFA. She gave us a new perspective that have led to changes on a lot of the details. Kristen was particularly focused on the accessibility and moderation needs of ARticulate. 

In terms of accessibility, Kristen noted that many of their visitors are older, so they might have had a child or grandchild set up their phone for them. If that the case, they won’t always know their Google password, so we want to provide alternate login options. Kristen appreciated the web app because the MFA is an international collection. There are museum visitors who can’t physically visit the museum but still might want to participate. This provides confirmation that the web app is an important part of ARticulate.  

Kristen also mentioned a few things that don’t seem very inviting about ARticulate. First, asking for demographic information at the beginning can turn people off. She has found more success when she asks for demographic information at the end of a survey, so we will change that order around. Second, Kristen mentioned how many visitors might feel like their response isn’t “smart enough” or that they might feel like they need an arts degree to be able to contribute. Our original wording of “enter your response” sounded like we were quizzing visitors, so we have updated that to a more inviting question: “what do you think about this artwork?”

As for moderation, Kristen told us stories of how she moderated the comment card walls that the MFA has implemented. She said during the weekends or when school groups came through, she might have to check the wall twice a day to remove disrespectful cards. Particularly, she thought giving people the ability to annotate over artwork might afford lude drawings. Because there are still strong benefits to annoying the artwork, we have settled on a moderation workflow where (1) visitors will submit responses, (2) museum staff will approve, and then (3) the responses will be viewable by others. 
We’ve also added notes about moderation to help dissuade disrespectful comments from the beginning. Kristen was also very much in favor of the emoji reactions rather than written reactions between visitors to decrease the amount of moderation. 


## UI/UX 
We've edited our wireframes to take the feedback we've received into consideration. 
Here's a [link](https://www.figma.com/proto/qWZ8ITvQK8M2P9pIW4IeyA/ARticulate?node-id=9%3A2&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1) to the updated mobile prototype. A data policy (wording is tentative) has been added to the begin page, so that we can be upfront to the user about how their data is used. Because having to login might dissuade users, we've moved the login page from right after opening the app to after the user indicates they want to respond to a piece of artwork. That way, users can still view others' responses without having to login. Kristen told us that regarding demographics, the MFA is interested in people of underrepresented races/ethnicities and sexual orientations. We're not quite sure how to ask people for that information within our app, or if our app should even be the place to ask for this. Since asking for demographic information might be offputting in general, we've temporarily removed it from our UX. 
Here's a [link](https://www.figma.com/file/PQIldnDWa6Jhb0wUKj2K4H/ARticulate-web-app?node-id=0%3A1) to the updated web app. The only noticeable design change is adding name/date to the AR annotations, so that it's clear in the ARticulation gallery that adjacent annotations and responses may not be related. 

## Technology
We've continued to implement features from the mockups in the functional prototype. There are several more frontend changes that need to be made but the appearance of the prototype is almost finalized at this point.

Our team recently discussed what our goals for the end of the semester were and decided to aim for a proof of concept that could be picked up by a different team in the future. As a result, our development tasks have changed. Since we won't have any actual user data to work with, fully prototyping a database won't be a priority. Instead we'll come up with a high level idea of how the app would interact with the database and simply build hooks into the code for now. Our main priorities going forward will be ensuring the codebase is as readable and scalable as possible and developing a more polished functional prototype.

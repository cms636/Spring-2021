[MuseoFuturo](http://jeffreyschnapp.com/2021/01/20/experimental-museology/) (“Future Museum”) is an experiment in museum-based education by Jeffrey Schanpp and others that reaches out not to museum professionals but rather to young practitioners in a range of creative and technical fields, inviting them to participate in the development of nine alternate visions of the future museum, while bringing the Madre’s own permanent collection –which, as is the case in most art museums, is mostly in storage– into public conversation.

museoFuturo’s themes are:

the museum as microscope

the museum as telescope

the museum as stage

the museum as warehouse

the museum as place of travel

the museum as toy

the museum as public square

the museum as laboratory

the museum as computer

title: AR.js Exercise - Trevor

I made a scene with multiple markers which control models that represent real world objects. I wanted to build a small, customizable village but because of time constraints I just implemented two basic objects, a house and a tree. With more time I would have liked to add one or two more unique objects and set up the scene to be able to register and track multiple instances of a single marker if possible.

I ran into a couple problems importing assets into my scene. I initially tried to use slightly more complex models but couldn't get them to render. I ended up just using several primitives to create each object instead. I also tried to create custom markers that used icons representing the objects they corresponded to but the icons weren't high enough quality to work so I just stuck with the presets.

Update: Reflecting on some of the other project ideas, I think this project could be easily adapted to include more of a museums history in its design and focus. Joy's idea made me think that maybe the outdoor space could be used as a way to 'trace' the history of an object along a physical path, with different AR elements corresponding to key points in the outdoor environment. Additionally, Trevor's idea of using AR to complete missing pieces or highlight what an earlier verision of something looked like could be adapted to using older photographs of outdoor areas as clues to highlight how an area has changed over time and make finding where different clues point to a bit more interesting. I'm not super committed to this idea, and would be open to helping someone else pursue an alternative project as well. 

Outdoor spaces on museum grounds can be important places for people to socialize and enjoy the atmosphere of the museum, but their artistic value can go underappreciated compared to the indoor galleries. For my project Iâ€™d propose a scavenger-hunt like experience where museum goers are given images taken from different parts of the museum grounds. When the user finds the area pictured, they can unlock audio or videos of members of the museum talking about how it was created or acquired for the museum. The goal would be to introduce visitors to parts of the museum they may otherwise overlook, and highlight the artistic value of aspects of the museum outside the gallery walls. This was envisioned with the Getty Center gardens in mind, but could easily be adapted to other museums. For easy accessibility, a web-based app would likely be the approach for the project.
